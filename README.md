LoC SAS
=================================

This project demonstrates a copyright application portal. Users can submit applications with attachments. Administrators can move the applications through various states and can perform reporting tasks across all applications.

# Installation

### Dependencies

 - This project is built on [Flask-AppBuilder](https://github.com/dpgaspar/Flask-AppBuilder) and tested against Python 3.6+ in [CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/github/GovWizely/loc-sas/pipelines).
 - The frontend utilizes Vue JS; NPM is required to build and run it [Install NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

### Local Development

Set up your virtual environment with all the necessary packages:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:GovWizely/loc-sas.git
cd loc-sas
mkvirtualenv -p /usr/local/bin/python3.7 -r requirements.txt loc-sas
```

If you are using PyCharm, make sure you enable code compatibility inspections for Python 3.6/3.7/3.8.

### Running locally
***Backend***

These commands will remove any stray local Sqlite database, create some test data and test users, create an admin user, and run the Flask application.
```
rm -f app.db
python testdata.py
flask fab create-admin --username admin --password admin --email admin@example.org --firstname admin --lastname user
FLASK_APP=app/__init__.py FLASK_DEBUG=1 flask run 
```

Open `http://localhost:5000` and log in as `user1`, `user2`, or `user3` with password `password`. Or login with `admin/admin`.

***Frontend***
```
cd client 
npm install
npm run serve
```

To build the frontend into the flask server for production: 
```
cd ..
./build-client.sh
```

### Testing
***Backend***

To run the backend test-suite along with linting:
```
make test-local
```

To run a single test:
1. Annotate the test with `@pytest.mark.focus`
1. `python -m pytest -s --disable-pytest-warnings -m focus`

***Frontend***

To run the frontend test-suite:
```
cd client 
npm test
```

***SonarQube***

You can run LoC's SonarQube analysis locally against your current feature branch.

[Download the sonar scanner](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/scan/sonarscanner/) for your development environment OS.

Set up this environment variable based on where you installed the scanner:
```
export SONAR_SCANNER=/Users/loren/Downloads/sonar-scanner-4.2.0.1873-macosx/bin/sonar-scanner
```

Ensure your LoC VPN is enabled.

Generate the test results in the Cobertura format that SonarQube requires and send the results in to the scanner:

```
make sonarqube
```

### Features

* "Active admin"-like functionality around a basic copyright application (name, title, date, PDF upload)
* DB-backed security for admin role and user role
* Admin user sees all applications, can visualize usage, and can "approve" applications 
* Users only see their own applications, and cannot edit or delete them once they are created
